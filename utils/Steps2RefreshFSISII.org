* Fish Stocking Data
1. Download FSIS and Rebuild FS_Master
2. Clone FS_Master (clone_fs_master.py)
3. Migrate sqlite clone to postgres by running migrate_data.py

* CWT Recoveries

see: [[c:/1work/Python/djcode/fsis2/cwts/utils/README.org]]

* Popups

The stocking events, cwts recoveries and stocking sites have popop
text associated with them.  For performance reasons, the popup text is
saved in a database field that is populated when each of the objects
are saved using the ORM.  The popup text will not be populated when
fsis2 database is recreated from fs_master.  To populate the popup
text, open a django shell query all events, sites and cwt recoveries.
Loop over each object and call its save method.  The popup text fields
should then be populated and available on the application maps.


* Spatial Data and Shapefiles
